- ### 2. **Geofenced Clock-In/Clock-Out**
- Managers set a **perimeter(lat, long)  radius** (e.g., 2 km) for shift logging.
- Care workers can only clock in/out when within the allowed perimeter.If workers are inside the permiter a notification will pops up saying to clock-in in live when workers are outside notigication will pops to      clock-out
- If outside the perimeter, the app notifies them as outside permiter and prevents logging if there is no shift(clock-in) app prevents to clock-out.
- Also They can add an optional Note while clock-in or clock-out
