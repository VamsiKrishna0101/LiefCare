# TakeCare – Healthcare Worker Shift Management

TakeCare is a web-based application designed for healthcare organizations (e.g., hospitals) to manage care workers’ shifts.  
It allows managers to monitor staff attendance, track clock-in/clock-out times, and view productivity metrics, while care workers can log their shifts securely — even with **face recognition**
